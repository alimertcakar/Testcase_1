## Task

Move function moves a file to a folder.

## DISCLAIMER: Solution 1 - 2

Solution 1: Performance based approach, runs extremely fast.
Solution 2: Scalable object oriented approach, still fast but better code quality IMO.



## Performance

Both solution 1 and solution 2 is fast, solution 1 is faster because it only does 2 passes or less. Also lesser instantiation costs may have effected the test. Both are well under 1 milliseconds, I didn't bother to optimize further because:

## Tests

All passing with additional tests
