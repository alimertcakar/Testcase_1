## Task

Move function moves a file to a folder.

## DISCLAIMER: Solution 1 - 2

Solution 1: Performance based approach, runs extremely fast.
Solution 2: Object oriented approach, I aimed for higher code quality. Slightly slower.

## Performance

![performance](C:\Users\Monst\OneDrive\Belgeler\GitHub\FarmaborsaCore\Testcase_1\doc\performance.png)

Both solution 1 and solution 2 is fast, solution 1 is faster because it only does 2 passes or less. Instantiation costs may have effected the tests. 

## Tests

All passing with additional tests
